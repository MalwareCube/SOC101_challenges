    "instructions": "<p>You are a SOC Analyst at <i>Meoware Labs</i>. Over the past few months, your team has accumulated a significant backlog of malware samples. These samples have been collected from various sources such as phishing emails, suspicious downloads, and through user reports.</p> <p>To address this challenge, the organization has recently invested in enhancing its malware detection and threat intelligence capabilities by adopting YARA. Your task is to leverage your newly acquired YARA expertise to develop and refine YARA rules to better detect the threats and artifacts associated with these malware samples.</p><h3>Challenge Directory:</h3><p><ul><li><code>05_Threat_Intelligence/YARA/Challenges/</code></li></ul></p>",
